# Bug Fix Summary - Python Service Not Running

## Problem
When clicking the "Run" button, the button changed to "Starting..." and kept spinning indefinitely. After refreshing, the button showed "Stop" and clicking it showed "Project stopped successfully". However, the `python-service/telegram_service.log` file remained empty, indicating the Python script wasn't being called.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Missing PYTHON_SERVICE_URL Environment Variable
- **Location**: `backend/queue.js` line 47
- **Issue**: `process.env.PYTHON_SERVICE_URL` was `undefined`, causing axios to call `undefined/send_message`
- **Fix**: Added fallback value: `const PYTHON_SERVICE_URL = process.env.PYTHON_SERVICE_URL || 'http://localhost:8000';`

### 2. Incorrect Redis Connection Configuration
- **Location**: `backend/queue.js` lines 1-23
- **Issue**: Code was using `redis` package (v4) client directly, but BullMQ expects an `ioredis` connection configuration object
- **Problem**: 
  - Created Redis client with `Redis.createClient()` 
  - Tried to use it directly with BullMQ Queue and Worker
  - Lock management code called methods on the wrong client type
- **Fix**: 
  - Changed to use plain configuration object for BullMQ: `{ host, port, password }`
  - Created separate `ioredis` client for lock management
  - Updated lock acquisition/release to use the ioredis client

## Changes Made

### File: `backend/queue.js`

1. **Removed redis package import, added ioredis**:
   ```javascript
   const IORedis = require('ioredis');
   ```

2. **Changed connection from client to config object**:
   ```javascript
   // Before:
   const redisConnection = Redis.createClient({ host, port, password });
   
   // After:
   const redisConnection = { host, port, password };
   const redisClient = new IORedis(redisConnection);
   ```

3. **Added fallback for PYTHON_SERVICE_URL**:
   ```javascript
   const PYTHON_SERVICE_URL = process.env.PYTHON_SERVICE_URL || 'http://localhost:8000';
   ```

4. **Added logging for debugging**:
   - Log when worker processes a job
   - Log the Python service URL being called
   - Log when session is locked

5. **Fixed lock management**:
   - Changed `redisConnection.set()` to `redisClient.set()` with ioredis syntax
   - Changed `redisConnection.get/del()` to `redisClient.get/del()`

## Verification Steps

1. **Check Python service is running**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   # Should return: {"status":"healthy","service":"python-pyrogram-service"}
   ```

2. **Check backend is running**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/health
   # Should return: {"status":"OK","service":"telegram-app-backend"}
   ```

3. **Check Redis is running**:
   ```bash
   redis-cli ping
   # Should return: PONG
   ```

4. **Test the run button**:
   - Create a project with sessions, targets, and messages
   - Click "Run"
   - Check backend console for worker logs
   - Check `python-service/telegram_service.log` for activity

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. When "Run" button is clicked:
   - Backend creates jobs in Redis queue
   - Worker picks up jobs and logs: `[Worker] Processing job X for chat Y`
   - Worker calls Python service: `[Worker] Calling Python service at http://localhost:8000/send_message`
   - Python service logs activity to `telegram_service.log`
   - Messages are sent to Telegram channels

2. Logs should appear in:
   - Backend console (worker activity)
   - `python-service/telegram_service.log` (detailed Telegram operations)
   - Database logs table (success/error counts)

## Additional Notes

- The Python service was already running correctly on port 8000
- Redis was already running correctly
- The issue was purely in the backend queue worker configuration
- No changes needed to Python service or frontend
- Nodemon should auto-restart the backend when changes are detected
